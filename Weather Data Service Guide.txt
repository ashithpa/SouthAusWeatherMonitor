API (ASP.NET Core Web API):
--------------------------------
A RESTful HTTP service deployable on IIS that retrieves comprehensive weather observation data for any station in South Australia. The API includes fields such as Name, Weather, local_date_time, apparent_temperature, air_temperature, dew_point, and cloud, returning data in JSON format.

Prerequisite - Please update the BaseURL (API URL) in the Client App.Config file: 
<add key="BaseUrl" value="http://localhost:5083" />


Output:
The API outputs the average temperature along with a formatted list of all observations retrieved. 
Note - Assuming air_temp is the property representing temperature

Components:
WeatherController.cs:
Defines routes and manages HTTP requests for weather data retrieval using the IWeatherService.

IWeatherService.cs:
Interface defining the GetWeatherObservationsAsync method for asynchronous weather data retrieval.

WeatherService.cs:
Implements IWeatherService, handling HTTP requests to external APIs, processing responses into ObservationData.

Console Application:
-------------------
The console application interacts with the deployed API, prompts users for a stationID via console input, and displays the results.

Shared Model:
------------
Contains classes ensuring consistency in data structures and logic across the API, console application, and potential testing scenarios.
